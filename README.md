# development method of Multi calculator online
Our software are using agile development to develop all the processing and schedule ,the reason why we choose agile method is because agile the first aim is for client and make sure the calculator needs are fit to market client, and let the customers to test and launch in the process to test our software can it fit their requirements and expectations, and the agile development is flexible, allowing you to adapt and change your plans as needed. This is especially useful for multi calculator websites, where you may discover new user needs or features as you progress, agile development follows an iterative approach, meaning you can develop the website in stages, with each iteration building on the previous one. This allows you to refine and improve the product as you go along, based on feedback and testing. And the mostly important reason is Agile allows for faster development cycles, meaning you can get your website to market faster. This is important for multi calculator websites, where users may be looking for a quick and efficient tool.

# Software process
Our software process first Define the requirements for calculator, including the types of calculators you want to include, the user interface, and any special features or functionality , next step we begin to think about the design.
 so the first think we are going to take a loop the popular calculator to reference, then create the design and try on into website, those designs are included by the layout, color scheme, function color background color and user interface etc. 
after design finish, we build the website using a programming language such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those language are the most common language of a web application software.
After the build finished, the Test your website to ensure that it works as expected and is free from bugs or errors, what if we find the bug or error we can quickly change and fix to code immediately .
We will deploy the web application to a server or hosting platform so that it can be accessed by users., example like amazon ec2 mircosoft azune, or cloud platform digital ocean.
In the final we will Continuously monitor and maintain  website to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date.  may need to update software components, fix bugs or errors, or add new features over time.
# algorithm
before the programming and design, we analysis for the goal the risk, so we found that there are not that much calculator model in the internet, and their model and UI is already out dated, so we confirm our application software that can aim to market. after that we first decide what function that we should include in our model,after this beta we will release more function and model , and we also implemented for  user can change the interface model  who want to use different interface. in the files structure , we seperated the home , and different which mean it's on a mvc sctructure which we can test and implement new function easily .

# current status
the  application are not yet host at server, can just run at local environment. the web now include index(homepage), base calculator ,ios model calculator and Scientific Calculator,those calculator are  include the base function of calculator . the Scientific Calculator include some additional math function example like (sin cos tan csc sec cot etc.)

# Future plan
For the future plan, we Consider adding additional calculators to my website to increase its functionality and usefulness that we might add calculators related to finance, health, fitness, currency or any other area that is relevant to.

Authentication: implement the authentication function for user that who login can
Get newer calculator model (beta) to try, and users should login first before they
Use the calculator, we also can implement a subscribe function for website to earn more money.

Adjustment the size of calculator: in the demo our calculator are not a inconsistent size, we will fix and keep implement to find the perfect for all the users and fit it all.

Improve user experience: keep improve my website is easy to navigate and use. Consider adding features like autocomplete or dropdown menus to make it easier for users to input data. Also, consider adding helpful messages or tooltips to guide users through the process.

Mobile optimization: for mobile devices. More and more people are accessing the internet using their phones, so it's important to ensure that looks and works great on smaller screens.

Analytics: Use analytics tools to track and record the usage of calculators. This will give me the insights into which calculators are being used the most, and which ones could be improved or removed.

Feedback: implement the feedback function and Encourage users to leave feedback on website and use that feedback to make improvements.
